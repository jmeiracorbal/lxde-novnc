This project provides a graphical interface for Linux desktop with [noVNC](https://novnc.com/info.html) (on browser) through the signal of `x11vnc` server using webSockets. 

> It's ideal for remote access, testing or educational sandboxes. Security improvements are implemented but you can configure over you own responsability.

# Getting started

Quickly deploy, creating the `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  desktop:
    image: jmeiracorbal/lxde-novnc:latest
    container_name: lxde-novnc
    ports:
      - "6080:6080"
      - "5900:5900"
    environment:
      - SYSTEM_USER=docker
      - VNC_PASS=letmein
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Execute the compose file:

```yaml
docker compose up -d
```

Required ports:

* `6080`: creates the access via browser.

Optional ports:

* `5900`: Add if you need VNC access with a traditional client (e.g. `Apache Guacamole`).

> After running, go to open [localhost on port :6080](http://localhost:6080) and you'll see the LXDE desktop running on your browser.

# How it works

The internal signal from x11vnc is redirected using webSockets with websockify. noVNC show this signtal on browser.

![alt text](./docs/images/flujo-xvfb-x11vnc.png "Flow xvfb redirect to x11vnc")

## Xvfb (virtual framebuffer)

It's the output inside container, but is not real because simulates a memory screen where is drawed the desktop environment. Has the `DISPLAY=:0` value like a real Linux desktop app.

## x11vnc server

This project uses VNC protocol, like RDP (Remote Desktop), x11... In remote. `x11vnc` is the VNC server where the desktop is drawed. It's drawed in background; the panel, windows, menus... Over the framebuffer (:0) that provides `Xvfb`.

## webSockify

Connect VNC protocol through web sockets. The bridge is listen on port 6080 (HTTP/WebSocket) to translate WebSocket signal to TCP, and redirect the traffic inside port 5900, where is the real VNC server listen.

## noVNC

It's a VNC client library. Required to access on the browser. [Check this project](https://github.com/novnc/noVNC).

# Setup and customization

You can customize the container using the environment variables in your compose file or using docker run command:

* `SYSTEM_USER`: refers to the Linux user running the desktop session inside the container.
* `VNC_PASS`: VNC password used if authentication is enabled. Default value is letmein.
* `RESOLUTION`: screen resolution of the virtual desktop (WxH). The default value is 1280x720.
* `DISPLAY`: it's the virtual display number (should not be changed). The default value is :0.

Example usage with custom resolution and credentials:

```yaml
environment:
  - SYSTEM_USER=alice
  - VNC_PASS=s3cr3t
  - RESOLUTION=1440x900
```

> Server x11vnc exposes a graphical session running with the configured user (`docker` as default). This isn't the user required for VNC/noVNC.

## About security

You must to known: 
- The desktop is only running with the default user, for simplicity.
- This option is very light and quickly to run, ideal for sandbox or educational environments or tests...

> If you need a more stricted authentication, see the [Authentication and security](#authentication-and-security) section to known how to configure it.

# Authentication and security

The container use VNC password authentication as default (x11vnc is started with the flag `-nopw`). If you doesn't want the password protection as required, add the environment variable `ALLOW_NOPW` as false value.

## What is it covered with x11vnc with VNC_PASS

The parameter `VNC_PASS` on the compose only protects the connection to the VNC server. Anyway, this password blocks somebody that want to open a his client VNC and trying to access to the server.
* If you use `-nopw` anybody can access to the VNC serser without autentication.
*  If you remove it and add a password, this password was required to connect with a VNC client, but this actions it isn't a system authentication.

# Customize the panel

The desktop panel has been preconfigured to provide a clean and minimal interface, but it's my own configuration. For example, you need to known that this components aren't included:
- No CPU usage monitor. Fails on runtime with Docker on this moment.
- No Desktop Pager (breaks the taskbar).

The traditional LXDE layout is preserved. If you want to customize the panel, you can edit the panel definition file before building the image:

![alt text](./docs/images/default-lxpanel-config.png)

You can create on your project this structure:

```bash
mkdir -p config/lxpanel/LXDE/panels/panel
```

This panel file controls appearance and contents of the LXDE panel. You can add or remove elements: application launchers, taskbar, shutdown/logout buttons, etc.

Example:

```yaml
services:
  desktop:
    image: jmeiracorbal/lxde-novnc:latest
    ports:
      - "6080:6080"
      - "5900:5900"
    volumes:
      - ./config/lxpanel/LXDE/panels/panel:/home/docker/.config/lxpanel/LXDE/panels/panel:ro
    environment:
      - SYSTEM_USER=docker
      - VNC_PASS=letmein
    restart: unless-stopped
```

The path `config/lxpanel/LXDE/panels/panel` represents the real structure on the system, but you can
include your own path on compose volume:

```yaml
    volumes:
      - ./panel:/home/docker/.config/lxpanel/LXDE/panels/panel:ro
```

When the container starts, the system will load your custom panel layout instead of the default.

## Minimal configuration for LXPanel

>Important: you need to add the specific components recommended if you need a minimal desktop environment.

The panel configuration file is a complete layout definition. If you override it using a custom file, you need to known that the file contains all the minimal components to work correctly by default.

Example: if your file only defines the digital clock plugin, only the clock will appear on the panel. You wonâ€™t see the menu, taskbar or any other element unless the declared.

You can use the example. Copy and replace it by your custom lxpanel:

```bash
cp ./examples/panel ./lxpanel/panel
```

# Disclaimers 

> The most important idea is to create a minimal desktop experience that will run on any platform with Docker using Linux, macOS (Silicon, Intel) or Windows without any other compoments.

Improvements are welcome, but this is a personal project designed to assist my own daily work. Issues might exist and will be handled as the time permits.
